A toolkit for testing browser automation engines against modern web protection systems. It checks how well each engine can bypass bot detection and measures their speed, resource usage, and resistance to fingerprinting.

## üéØ Overview
Modern web applications use advanced bot detection like Cloudflare, DataDome, and Imperva to block automated access. This benchmark suite shows how different browser automation engines handle these defenses:
- **Bypass Success Rate**: Effectiveness against major protection systems
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU consumption, and page load times
- **Fingerprinting Resistance**: reCAPTCHA scores and CreepJS trust ratings
- **Network Analysis**: IP detection (proxy validation) and WebRTC leak testing

## üöÄ Key Features
### Protection System Testing
- **Cloudflare** 
- **DataDome**   
- **Amazon** 
- **Google Search** 
- **Ticketmaster (Imperva)**
- <i>More systems coming soon</i>

### Analytics
- Automated report generation with visualizations
- Performance profiling and resource usage tracking
- Exportable results in JSON and Markdown formats

## üîí **Important: Proxy Requirements**
**Using a clean proxy is essential for accurate benchmark results.**
<details>
<summary>Why Proxies Are Required</summary>

- **IP Reputation**: Your home/datacenter IP may already be flagged by protection systems from previous automation attempts, browser extensions, or security software
- **Clean Testing Environment**: A fresh proxy IP ensures you're testing the browser engine's capabilities, not your IP's reputation
- **Rate Limiting**: Repeated tests from the same IP can trigger rate limiting, affecting bypass success rates
</details>

## üìä Sample Results
This benchmark provides detailed comparative analysis. Here's an excerpt from a recent test run (more in <a href="results/example">results/example</a>):  
<i>Real IP in this example - 169.150.201.11</i>  
<i>Proxy IP in this example is different for each engine</i>

### Overall Bypass Rate
| Engine | Bypass Rate (%) |
|-----------------|----------------:|

| camoufox | 1080.0 | 36.4 |
| camoufox_headless | 1097.0 | 20.7 |

If the CPU usage is 0 - failed to measure or it really is 0 for CDP sessions. The problem is known and will be fixed.

### Recaptcha Scores - https://antcpt.com/score_detector
| Engine | Recaptcha Score (0-1) |
|-----------------|--------------------:|
| tf-playwright-stealth-chromium | 0.30 |
| camoufox | 0.10 |
| patchright | 0.10 |
| camoufox_headless | 0.10 |
| patchright_headless | 0.10 |
| playwright-chrome | 0.10 |
| playwright-firefox | 0.10 |
| playwright-chrome_headless | 0.10 |
| playwright-firefox_headless | 0.10 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-chromium_headless | 0.10 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-firefox | 0.10 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-firefox_headless | 0.10 |
| nodriver-chrome | nan |
| nodriver-chrome_headless | nan |

`
This Score is taken by solving the reCAPTCHA v3 on your browser.
The Score shows if Google considers you as HUMAN or BOT.
1.0 is very likely a good interaction, 0.0 is very likely a bot
With low score values (< 0.3) you'll get a slow reCAPTCHA 2, it would be hard to solve it.
And vise versa, with score >= 0.7 it will be much easier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techinz/browsers-benchmark.git
   cd browsers-benchmark
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install browser engines**

   **Playwright**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   # On Linux also run:
   playwright install-deps
   ```

   **Camoufox**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   camoufox fetch
   
   # Linux  
   python -m camoufox fetch
   sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-0 libx11-xcb1 libasound2
   ```

   **Patchright**
   ```bash
   patchright install chromium
   ```

4. **Configure settings**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your proxy settings if needed
   ```

5. **Configure proxies**
   1. Create a file named `proxies.txt` in the `documents` directory.
   2. Add your proxy URLs in format `http://username:password@proxy_host:port` or `http://proxy_host:port`.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (1): Number of proxies has to be not less than number of engines you want to test.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (2): Some engines support different proxy protocols - for example, Playwright supports only HTTP and HTTPS, but NoDriver supports only SOCKS5.  
         This implies that you have to add multiple proxy protocols to the `proxies.txt` file or exclude some engines from the test.  
         At the moment you need all HTTP/HTTPS proxies and at least 1 SOCKS5 for NoDriver. Also, the benchmark will show you what proxy protocols are missing.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (3): Selenium won't use any proxies.  

   Example `proxies.txt` content (each line is a separate proxy):
   ```
   http://proxy1.example.com:8080
   http://proxy2.example.com:8080
   http://username:password@proxy3.example.com:8080
   http://username:password@proxy4.example.com:8080
   socks5://username:password@proxy5.example.com:8080
   ```

6. **Run benchmark**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Proxy Configuration (highly recommended to enable)
PROXY_ENABLED=true

PROXY_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Performance Settings

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture for extensibility:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engines/          # Browser engine implementations  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ targets/      # Test target definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report/       # Report generation system
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/      # Structured logging
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/          # Output directory
```

### Adding New Targets
1. Modify `config/benchmark_targets.py` to add custom test targets:

    ```python
    Target(
        name="custom_site",
        url="https://example.com",
        check_function="check_custom_bypass",
        description="Custom site protection test"
    )
    ```
2. Create a check function for the target in `utils/targets/check_bypass`, for example in a file named `custom_bypass.py`:
    ```python
    from engines.base import BrowserEngine

    async def check_custom_bypass(engine: BrowserEngine) -> bool:
        element_found, element_html = await engine.locator('//div[@class="captcha"]')

        return not element_found # no captcha found - success!
    ```
3. Add it to the checkers mapping in `config/benchmark_targets.py`'s `BypassTargetsSettings`:
    ```python
    checkers: Dict[str, Callable] = Field(
        default_factory=lambda: {
            "check_cloudflare_bypass": check_cloudflare_bypass,
            "check_datadome_bypass": check_datadome_bypass,
            ...
            "check_custom_bypass": check_custom_bypass,
        }
    )
    ```

### Adding New Engines
1. Extend the `BrowserEngine` base class:

   ```python  
   class CustomEngine(BrowserEngine):
       async def start(self) -> None:
           # Initialize browser
           
       async def navigate(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
           # Navigation logic
   ```
   
   Or, if Playwright-based, extend `PlaywrightBase` base class:
   ```python  
   class CustomPlaywrightBasedEngine(PlaywrightBase):
       ...
   ```
   
    Or, if Selenium-based, extend `SeleniumBase` base class:
   ```python  
   class CustomSeleniumBasedEngine(SeleniumBase):
       ...
   ```
   
2. Add it to the engines mapping in `config/engines.py`'s `EnginesSettings`:
    ```python
    base_engines = [
            {
                "class": PlaywrightEngine,
                "params": {"headless": True, "name": "playwright-chrome_headless", "browser_type": "chromium"}
            },
            ...
            {
                "class": CustomEngine,
                "params": {"headless": True, "name": "custom_engine", "browser_type": "chromium"}
            }
   ]
    ```
