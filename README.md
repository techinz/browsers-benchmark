## üéØ Overview
Modern web applications use advanced bot detection like Cloudflare, DataDome, and Imperva to block automated access. This benchmark suite shows how different browser automation engines handle these defenses:
- **Bypass Success Rate**: Effectiveness against major protection systems
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory usage, CPU consumption, and page load times
- **Fingerprinting Resistance**: reCAPTCHA scores and CreepJS trust ratings
- **Network Analysis**: IP detection (proxy validation) and WebRTC leak testing

## üöÄ Key Features
### Protection System Testing
- **Cloudflare** 
- **DataDome**   
- **Amazon** 
- **Google Search** 
- **Ticketmaster (Imperva)**
- <i>More systems coming soon</i>

- <a href="https://github.com/cdpdriver/zendriver">**ZenDriver**</a> - NoDriver-based
- <i>More engines coming soon. What engine should I add next?</i>

### Analytics
- Automated report generation with visualizations
- Performance profiling and resource usage tracking
- Exportable results in JSON and Markdown formats

## üîí **Important: Proxy Requirements**
**Using a clean proxy is essential for accurate benchmark results.**
<details>
<summary>Why Proxies Are Required</summary>

- **IP Reputation**: Your home/datacenter IP may already be flagged by protection systems from previous automation attempts, browser extensions, or security software
- **Clean Testing Environment**: A fresh proxy IP ensures you're testing the browser engine's capabilities, not your IP's reputation
- **Rate Limiting**: Repeated tests from the same IP can trigger rate limiting, affecting bypass success rates
</details>

## üìä Sample Results
This benchmark provides detailed comparative analysis. Here's an excerpt from a recent test run (more in <a href="results/example">results/example</a>):  
<i>Real IP in this example - 149.102.240.71</i>

### Recaptcha Scores - https://antcpt.com/score_detector
| Engine | Recaptcha Score (0-1) |
|-----------------|--------------------:|
| camoufox | 0.30 |
| nodriver-chrome | 0.30 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-firefox | 0.30 |
| nodriver-chrome_headless | 0.30 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-chromium_headless | 0.30 |
| zendriver-chrome_headless | 0.30 |
| selenium-chrome__no_proxy | 0.30 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-firefox_headless | 0.30 |
| camoufox_headless | 0.10 |
| patchright | 0.10 |
| playwright-firefox_headless | 0.10 |
| playwright-firefox | 0.10 |
| playwright-chrome_headless | 0.10 |
| playwright-chrome | 0.10 |
| patchright_headless | 0.10 |
| selenium-chrome_headless__no_proxy | 0.10 |
| tf-playwright-stealth-chromium | 0.10 |
| zendriver-chrome | 0.10 |

Note: `
This Score is taken by solving the reCAPTCHA v3 on your browser.
The Score shows if Google considers you as HUMAN or BOT.
1.0 is very likely a good interaction, 0.0 is very likely a bot
With low score values (< 0.3) you'll get a slow reCAPTCHA 2, it would be hard to solve it.
And vise versa, with score >= 0.7 it will be much easier. 
`

Note: 
1. CreepJS disabled trust and bot scores for now - https://github.com/abrahamjuliot/creepjs/issues/292
2. If the WebRTC IP is different from your real IP - no leakage (applicapable only with proxy).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Start
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techinz/browsers-benchmark.git
   cd browsers-benchmark
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install browser engines**

   **Playwright**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   # On Linux also run:
   playwright install-deps
   ```

   **Camoufox**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   camoufox fetch
   
   # Linux  
   python -m camoufox fetch
   sudo apt install -y libgtk-3-0 libx11-xcb1 libasound2
   ```

   **Patchright**
   ```bash
   patchright install chromium
   ```

4. **Configure settings**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your proxy settings if needed
   ```

5. **Configure proxies**
   1. Create a file named `proxies.txt` in the `documents` directory.
   2. Add your proxy URLs in format `http://username:password@proxy_host:port` or `http://proxy_host:port`.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (1): Number of proxies has to be not less than number of engines you want to test.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (2): Some engines support different proxy protocols - for example, Playwright supports only HTTP and HTTPS, but NoDriver supports only SOCKS5.  
         This implies that you have to add multiple proxy protocols to the `proxies.txt` file or exclude some engines from the test.  
         At the moment you need all HTTP/HTTPS proxies and at least 1 SOCKS5 for NoDriver. Also, the benchmark will show you what proxy protocols are missing.  
      ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT (3): Selenium won't use any proxies.  

   Example `proxies.txt` content (each line is a separate proxy):
   ```
   http://proxy1.example.com:8080
   http://proxy2.example.com:8080
   http://username:password@proxy3.example.com:8080
   http://username:password@proxy4.example.com:8080
   socks5://username:password@proxy5.example.com:8080
   ```

6. **Run benchmark**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Proxy Configuration (highly recommended to enable)
PROXY_ENABLED=true
PROXY_FILE_PATH=documents/proxies.txt
PROXY_MAX_RETRIES=3

# Performance Settings
PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT_S=90
PAGE_STABILIZATION_DELAY_S=5
MAX_RETRIES=3
```

## üìà Output & Reports

The benchmark generates reports in the `results/` directory:

- **`summary.md`** - Human-readable markdown report
- **`benchmark_results.json`** - Raw data for further analysis  
- **`media/`** - Generated visualizations and screenshots
  - `bypass_dashboard.png` - Multi-metric dashboard
  - `recaptcha_scores.png` - reCAPTCHA performance chart
  - `creepjs_scores.png` - Fingerprinting resistance analysis
  - `screenshots` - Screenshots of all tested targets

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The codebase follows a modular architecture for extensibility:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engines/          # Browser engine implementations  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ targets/      # Test target definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ report/       # Report generation system
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/      # Structured logging
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ results/          # Output directory
```

### Adding New Targets
1. Modify `config/benchmark_targets.py` to add custom test targets:

    ```python
    Target(
        name="custom_site",
        url="https://example.com",
        check_function="check_custom_bypass",
        description="Custom site protection test"
    )
    ```
2. Create a check function for the target in `utils/targets/check_bypass`, for example in a file named `custom_bypass.py`:
    ```python
    from engines.base import BrowserEngine

    async def check_custom_bypass(engine: BrowserEngine) -> bool:
        element_found, element_html = await engine.locator('//div[@class="captcha"]')

        return not element_found # no captcha found - success!
    ```
3. Add it to the checkers mapping in `config/benchmark_targets.py`'s `BypassTargetsSettings`:
    ```python
    checkers: Dict[str, Callable] = Field(
        default_factory=lambda: {
            "check_cloudflare_bypass": check_cloudflare_bypass,
            "check_datadome_bypass": check_datadome_bypass,
            ...
            "check_custom_bypass": check_custom_bypass,
        }
    )
    ```

### Adding New Engines
1. Extend the `BrowserEngine` base class:

   ```python  
   class CustomEngine(BrowserEngine):
       async def start(self) -> None:
           # Initialize browser
           
       async def navigate(self, url: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
           # Navigation logic
   ```
   
   Or, if Playwright-based, extend `PlaywrightBase` base class:
   ```python  
   class CustomPlaywrightBasedEngine(PlaywrightBase):
       ...
   ```
   
    Or, if Selenium-based, extend `SeleniumBase` base class:
   ```python  
   class CustomSeleniumBasedEngine(SeleniumBase):
       ...
   ```
   
2. Add it to the engines mapping in `config/engines.py`'s `EnginesSettings`:
    ```python
    base_engines = [
            {
                "class": PlaywrightEngine,
                "params": {"headless": True, "name": "playwright-chrome_headless", "browser_type": "chromium"}
            },
            ...
            {
                "class": CustomEngine,
                "params": {"headless": True, "name": "custom_engine", "browser_type": "chromium"}
            }
   ]
    ```

## üîß Platform-Specific Notes
